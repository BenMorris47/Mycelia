  title: Heavy Mushroom
  entry: "Today Whilst exploring the mines I came across this strange blue mushroom.
    When I touched it my arm feel heavy. I then proceeded to press it against different
    items and it had the same effect as it did on my arm. I plan to convert it into
    serum and see what effects it has. \r\n"
