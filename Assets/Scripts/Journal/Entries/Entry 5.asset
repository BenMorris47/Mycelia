  title: Animals and mushrooms
  entry: "I came across a sad discovery today, it seems that some of the wildlife
    on the island has been infected by the mushrooms. I saw mushrooms sprouting out
    of a family of turtles. I asked my superior whether we should take them in to
    see if we can stop it but he just shrugged me off. He\u2019s been acting strange
    recently, not only him. Rick has been going on and on about changing people into
    mushrooms. At first, I thought he was only joking but now I\u2019m not so sure.
    \r\n"
