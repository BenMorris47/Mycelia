  entry: "Today I got the letter that the mines are going to be shut down. It seems
    like the government is starting to take interest in what the hell is going on
    on this island. I heard rumors that they are going to change this to a research
    facility and that they are taking note of anyone who \u201C hears voices \u201C.
    I don\u2019t like this, seems like they\u2019ll be using them as lab rats."
