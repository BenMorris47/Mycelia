  title: Experiment entry 69
  entry: "For the last couple of weeks, professor Rick has been experimenting with
    combining and then consuming different mushrooms that are present on the island.
    Last night when we went to check on him we couldn\u2019t find him, instead, we
    found a big talking mushroom. We\u2019ve currently got it locked up, it keeps
    on insisting to call it Mushroom Rick. \r\n"
