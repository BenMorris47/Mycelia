  hintContent: 'Recovered files from HQ: Today Whilst exploring the mines I came
    across this strange blue mushroom. When I touched it my arm feel heavy. I then
    proceeded to press it against different items and it had the same effect as it
    did on my arm. I plan to convert it into serum and see what effects it has. '
